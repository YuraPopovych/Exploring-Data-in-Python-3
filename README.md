# Exploring-Data-in-Python-3
Simple exercises for learning purposes from book 
## 7.1
Write a program to prompt for a file name, and then read
through the file and look for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence: 0.8475
When you encounter a line that starts with “X-DSPAM-Confidence:”
pull apart the line to extract the floating-point number on the line.
Count these lines and then compute the total of the spam confidence
values from these lines. When you reach the end of the file, print out
the average spam confidence.

## 8.4 
Write a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For
each line, split the line into a list of words using the split function. For
each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is
not in the list, add it to the list. When the program completes, sort
and print the resulting words in alphabetical order.

## 8.5
Write a program to read through the mail box data and
when you find line that starts with “From”, you will split the line into
words using the split function.
From line, then you will also count the number of From (not From:)
lines and print out a count at the end. 

## 8.6 
Write the program that prompts the user for a list of
numbers and prints out the maximum and minimum of the numbers at
the end when the user enters “done”. Write the program to store the
numbers the user enters in a list and use the max() and min() functions to
compute the maximum and minimum numbers after the loop completes.

## 9.2 
Write a program that categorizes each mail message by
which day of the week the commit was done and count how often each day was there. 


## 9.3 
Add code to the above program to figure out who has the
most messages in the file.

## 9.4 
This program count the domain name from file
